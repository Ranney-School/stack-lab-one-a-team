Data Structures & Algorithms Activity: Stack Lab & ADTs in Action

Class Size: 3 students (working together)
Time: 50–55 minutes
Deliverable: Completed code file(s) + short reflection answers

Part 1 — Warm-Up Discussion (5–7 minutes)

Discuss as a group and jot down notes:

What is an Abstract Data Type (ADT)?

Why does it matter that a stack only has push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and size?

How do generics allow us to make stacks that can hold different types?

Part 2 — Hands-On Coding Challenge (35–40 minutes)

Work together on the following steps. Rotate who is typing (“driver”) every 10 minutes.
1. Complete the implementation of a stack in MyStack.java using an array.
2. Use StackTester.java to test your implementation.
3. Complete the checkBalanced() method in StackTester.java.

Part 3 — Reflection & Wrap-Up (7–8 minutes)

Answer these questions as a group:

How does the Stack ADT “hide” implementation details?

What advantages did generics give us in this activity?

Why is it useful to limit access to data through ADT operations instead of exposing the array directly?
